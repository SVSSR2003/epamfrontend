        <p>Russian shelling of the eastern Ukraine town of Sloviansk on Monday killed at least two people and wounded more than two dozen others, authorities said.
            "As of 13:00, there are two dead and 29 wounded in Sloviansk," Donetsk region governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Facebook.
            <br>
            He added that "administrative and office buildings, five high-rise buildings and seven private houses were damaged" in the attack.
            <br>
            "(Russian forces) struck the city centre around 10:30 (0730 GMT) with two S-300 missiles," he added.
            <br>
            Mr Kyrylenko also said that another town in Donetsk region, Druzhkivka, was targeted by an attack.
            <br>
            "Two S-300 missiles hit the Druzhkivka orphanage and almost completely destroyed it," he said, adding that according to initial information there were no casualties.
            <br>
            "Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Sloviansk," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.
            <br>
            "The enemy must know: Ukraine will not forgive the torturing of our people, will not forgive these deaths and wounds," he added.
            <br>
            Russian forces have made the capture of the Donetsk region their main military priority and claimed to have annexed the region last year despite not fully controlling it.</p>
